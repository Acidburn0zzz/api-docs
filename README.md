Packet API Documentation
========================

This is the source code for the Packet API documentation site.

Dependencies
------------

* `node.js`/`npm` (with `npm` in your `$PATH`): http://nodejs.org

Usage
-----

Our API docs use the [API Blueprint][1] specification. For a good example of
how to use that, see [their examples][2].

The Markdown files live in the `docs` directory. These are the files to edit if
you want to update the documentation itself.

To keep our docs manageable, each "section" of the API should be placed in
a new file in the `docs` directory. When the documentation site is compiled,
all of these files will be combined alphabetically (hence the `00#-` naming
scheme).

To compile the documentation, run the `bin/compile` script included in this
repo. The script will combine all of the files in the `docs` directory, then
use the [aglio][3] to convert the docs into a pretty static website in the `web` directory.
You'll need to set up a webserver to properly view the generated site, with the
docroot set to the `web` directory (Apache works fine for this).
